# sql_challenge


## Background

For this challenge, I was hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). My first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. That is, I performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

## Synopsis of Process

To tackle this challenge I...

1. Read and decoded the requirements of the challenge.
2. Brainstormed possible structures needed to accomplish the goals of the challenge.
3. Looked back at Bootcamp class activites to find code to accomplish processes.
4. Researched the resources listed below to find additional, or more elegant, code.
5. Cleaned and tested scripts.
