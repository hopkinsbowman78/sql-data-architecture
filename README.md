# sql-data-architecture

For this challenge, I was hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). My first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. That is, I performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.
